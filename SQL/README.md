I used SQL to clean and prepare the Nashville Housing Dataset. I employed many functions to perform data cleaning via SQL. 

I used DDL and DML commands in queries to work on this process. 

I addressed missing values by either updating the records using string split functions and trim functions to extract and standardize data from other columns, such as addresses. 

Usage of Common Table Expressions (CTE) to identify and remove duplicate records and them removed unused columns.  

Overall, leveraging SQL with these functions and techniques allowed me to efficiently manage and clean the dataset, enabling me to use the dataset further to derive meaningful insights from the data.
