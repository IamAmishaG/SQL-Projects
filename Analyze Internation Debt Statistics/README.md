# Overview of International Debt Analysis using SQL

This repository contains SQL code snippets that facilitate the analysis of international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset offers valuable insights into the debt landscape of developing countries across various categories. Through a series of SQL queries, we delve into different aspects of this dataset to gain a deeper understanding of global debt dynamics.

## Project Goals and Key Questions

The primary objective of this analysis is to extract meaningful insights from the international debt dataset. Key questions we seek to answer include:

- What is the total amount of debt owed by all countries in the dataset?
- Which country carries the highest debt burden, and what is the magnitude of this debt?
- What is the average debt amount owed by countries across different debt indicators?
- What are the distinct debt indicators, and how do countries distribute debt across these categories?

## SQL Code Snippets

1. **Connecting and Initial Exploration**: Establishing the connection to the dataset and retrieving a sample to understand the data's structure.
2. **Counting Distinct Countries**: Determining the number of unique countries in the dataset, providing context for subsequent analyses.
3. **Exploring Debt Indicators**: Identifying and listing the distinct debt indicators present in the dataset, which guide our understanding of different debt categories.
4. **Total Debt Calculation**: Calculating the overall sum of debt across all countries, offering a global perspective on debt accumulation.
5. **Country with Highest Debt**: Identifying the country with the highest debt amount and presenting the specific amount, providing insights into extreme cases.
6. **Average Debt across Indicators**: Computing the average debt amount within various debt indicators, revealing patterns of indebtedness.
7. **Highest Principal Repayments**: Identifying the category with the highest average debt (principal repayments), highlighting a critical aspect of debt management.
8. **Most Common Debt Indicator**: Determining the most prevalent debt indicator, showcasing the primary areas in which countries tend to accumulate debt.
9. **Additional Debt Issues**: Exploring countries with the highest individual debt amounts, suggesting other economic challenges beyond common indicators.

## Conclusion

This repository's SQL code snippets collectively offer a comprehensive exploration of international debt data. By addressing fundamental questions and examining distinct debt indicators, highest debts, and average debt trends, we gain valuable insights into the economic landscapes of developing countries. This analysis not only enriches our understanding of global economics but also aids in data-driven decision-making and policy formulation.
